# 🚨 CRITICAL: Deploy Issue Found

## 📊 Problem Analysis:
- ✅ Code.js is correct locally
- ❌ GAS deployment is NOT updated
- 🔍 Evidence: debugPOST returns "ข้อมูลไม่ครบถ้วน: accountId, assetId"
- 🔍 Evidence: GET endpoints still require authentication

## 🛠️ IMMEDIATE SOLUTION:

### Step 1: Force New Deployment (NOT Update)
```
1. Go to Google Apps Script Editor
2. Click "Deploy" → "NEW DEPLOYMENT" (not manage deployments)
3. Choose "Web app"
4. Set "Execute as: Me"
5. Set "Who has access: Anyone"
6. Click "Deploy"
7. COPY THE NEW URL
```

### Step 2: Update config.js with NEW URL
```javascript
export const APPS_SCRIPT_URL = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/NEW_DEPLOYMENT_ID_HERE/exec';
```

### Step 3: Update test files with NEW URL

## 🎯 Why Update Deploy Failed:
- GAS may have cached the old version
- Update deploy sometimes doesn't propagate changes properly
- New deployment ensures fresh deployment

## 📱 Quick Verification:
After new deployment, test this URL in browser:
```
https://NEW_URL/exec?action=testGetUserData
```

Should return user data without authentication error.

## ⚡ Alternative: Force Refresh Existing Deploy
If new deployment is not preferred:
1. In GAS Editor, go to "Deploy" → "Manage deployments"
2. Click "Archive" on current deployment
3. Create new deployment with same settings
4. This forces a complete refresh
